### Welcome
Hi!

Thank you for visiting [translatethe.news](https://translatethe.news). The name
says it all, this site is meant for providing news translations. From any
language to any language.

There has been a lot of talk about media bias recently, and this is an attempt
to reduce its effect a bit, by making media from more sources available to the
masses. It is hard to follow foreign media, for a large part due to language
barriers. However, with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com),
[Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org) and basic language skills it is not
too difficult (and great practice!) to translate foreign sources in a readable
and mostly correct manner.

This site has been online since late February 2017, so it should be seen as a
young seedling. There is a lot to be improved, and your input is very important
for that! Any kind of feedback is welcome and can be sent to
[translatethe.news@gmail.com](mailto:translatethe.news@gmail.com). Current
ideas for improvements include a voting system for interesting content and
a point system to reward users for their input and to turn this all into a bit
of a game. Also the site should of course become fully multilingual.

To contribute news translations, you can register for a user account, and add a
source article (for finding trending news in different regions you can use
[Google News](https://news.google.com)). Then view the article, and at the
bottom of the screen choose the language you want to translate to. Please stick
to freely available content, and make sure source and author information are
properly included to prevent copyright issues.

Hope to hear from you, and all the best!
